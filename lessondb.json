    "content": "Japanese is the official language of Japan, spoken by over 125 million people. It is known for its unique writing system, polite expressions, and rich cultural depth. Unlike English, Japanese uses three scripts: Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji. Hiragana is used for native Japanese words and grammar, Katakana is for foreign words and names, and Kanji consists of characters borrowed from Chinese that represent meanings or ideas.\nJapanese grammar is quite different from English. The typical sentence structure is Subject–Object–Verb (SOV). For example, instead of saying “I eat sushi,” in Japanese it becomes “I sushi eat” – Watashi wa sushi o tabemasu. Particles, such as wa and o, are small words that show the function of other words in a sentence.\nPoliteness is a key part of Japanese communication. The language changes depending on who you are talking to—friends, teachers, or strangers. Learning basic greetings like Konnichiwa (Hello), Arigatou (Thank you), and Sayounara (Goodbye) is a great way to start.\nStudying Japanese can be both challenging and rewarding. With practice and curiosity, learners gain insight into Japan’s culture, traditions, and way of thinking while building valuable language skills."

    "content": "Russian is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world. It can be found in many countries, in some more, in others less. Russian has its roots in the Slavic language family, so knowing it can make it easier to understand or learn other languages such as Latvian, Ukrainian, or Belarusian.\nTo communicate with Russian speakers without actually knowing the language, it’s recommended to learn some basic phrases and common expressions used in small talk."
