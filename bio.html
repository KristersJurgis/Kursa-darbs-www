            <h1>About myself</h1>
            <p>I am a 20 year old IT student, studying at Latvia university of Lifescience and Technologies.</p>
            <p>This is my course work fro Web system development project.</p>
            <h1>Why did i choose a language learning website as the theme?</h1>
            <p>I found it interesting, that i could combine multiple things into one, for exmaple, learning a new language/improving my skills in the language and learning how to develope websites using html/css/jscript and combining them with databases, like for this website, with jscript database.</p>
